# authentication-python
This repository has codes that shows how basic authentication is done using the python programming language

This repo contains two directories.
  Data (This is where the data will be stored)
  Scripts (This directory is where all the code is stored.)
  
 
 The scripts directory contains four main files
  validate.py
  sign_up.py
  sign_in.py
  main.py
  
  
How It Works.
  You run the main.py using (python or python3 main.py ../data/users.csv)
  
  You then select whether you want to sign up or login to an existing account.
  After selecting you will be prompted to enter some crendentials.
  Then the program will call the validate.py to check if the entered credentials are
  valid.
  If it is valid you will be logged in or registered with a new account.
